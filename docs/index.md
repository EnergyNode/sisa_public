# Introduction
SISA, which stands for SISO Impedance-Based Stability Analysis, is a desktop application to address dynamic issues in the power-electronics-based power system. It translates the dynamic interactions at selected multiple ports of the system to single-input single-output (SISO) minor loops in the freequency domain, of which the stability can be readily assessed by the SISO Nyquist stability criteria. It calculates the frequency-domain participation factor for the user to identify the most contributive components for the oscillation, and uses impedance shaping solution for the user to explore system stability enhancement solutions. In addition, it has the Impedance Scan function for various impedance-based analyses, including the above-mentioned stability analysis.

The scientific background of SISA can be found at [[@yang2022siso]].
